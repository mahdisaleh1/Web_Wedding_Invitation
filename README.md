# Web_Wedding_Invitation
This web page is design for invitations, that guests will receive the link with their guest_id and give confirmation about accept or decline invitation.
They are an admin dashboard, the man and women wedding can login using created account (email and password from DB) and add the guests list.
Each guest will get an guest_id distinct of each other, then when the link will be sent to guests the user should add at the end of the link ?guest="0000" (the "0000" is the guest_id of each guest). The guests can confirm the invitation (accept or decline) only once. After confirmation, a greating message will apper for the guest (such accept or decline confirmation).
The users can check accepted and declined confirmations from their dashboard. Make sure, the man can only see his guests added by him and the same case for woman.
